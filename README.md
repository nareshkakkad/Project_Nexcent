# Project Nexcent - Lessons and Insights Landing Page


At the time I am making this project, I haven't found any designs for medium-sized (md) and small devices (sm).
So, the responsive design of this template has been completely done by me.

This Project is hosted on vercel : [Nexcent](https://project-nexcent.vercel.app/)
